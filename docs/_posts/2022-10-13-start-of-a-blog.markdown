So while I made this site initially for a portfolio, the jekyll interface allows me to also have a blog.

While I was initially considering scrapping this section of the site, thinking about it more it may be able to act as a stepping stone for more expansive explanations of some of my works, which I *have* wanted to do in video format. A text-form may be able to help lay out the eventual blueprints for that, so I may use this soon, hopefully.

...here's a hamster.
